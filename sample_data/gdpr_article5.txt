GDPR Article 5: Principles Relating to Processing of Personal Data

Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes the fundamental principles for processing personal data. Organizations must ensure that personal data is:

1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. Data subjects must be informed about data collection and processing activities.

2. Purpose Limitation
Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

3. Data Minimization
Personal data collected must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. Organizations should not collect more data than needed.

4. Accuracy
Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate data must be erased or rectified without delay.

5. Storage Limitation
Personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed.

6. Integrity and Confidentiality
Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

7. Accountability
The data controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with all of the above principles.
