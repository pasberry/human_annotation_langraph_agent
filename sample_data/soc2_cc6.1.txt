SOC 2 Type II - Common Criteria 6.1 (CC6.1): Logical and Physical Access Controls

The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's objectives.

This criterion addresses the design, implementation, and monitoring of logical access controls to protect information assets from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. The controls include, but are not limited to:

1. Identification and Authentication
The entity's system requires unique user identification (user ID) and authentication to gain access to the system and its resources. Authentication mechanisms may include passwords, tokens, biometrics, or other multi-factor authentication methods.

2. Authorization
Once authenticated, users are granted access only to the information and system functionality necessary for their job responsibilities. This follows the principle of least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC).

3. Access Control Lists and Permissions
The system maintains access control lists (ACLs) that specify which users or groups have permission to access specific resources, such as databases, files, applications, and network segments.

4. Privileged Access Management
Access to privileged accounts (e.g., system administrators, database administrators) is restricted and monitored. Changes made using privileged accounts are logged and reviewed.

5. Remote Access
Remote access to the system is secured through encrypted connections (e.g., VPN, SSH) and requires multi-factor authentication where appropriate.

6. Password Management
The entity enforces password policies including complexity requirements, expiration periods, and restrictions on password reuse. Passwords are stored using strong cryptographic hashing.

Scoping Considerations:

Assets that fall IN-SCOPE for CC6.1 include:
- Production databases containing customer data, personal information, financial data, or other sensitive information
- Authentication systems and identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SSO systems)
- Systems that store, process, or transmit regulated data
- Infrastructure components with privileged access (servers, network devices, cloud resources)
- Applications that handle user authentication and authorization
- Systems accessible from external networks or the internet

Assets that fall OUT-OF-SCOPE for CC6.1 include:
- Development or test environments that do not contain production data
- Systems that only store public information with no access controls required
- Isolated internal tools that do not process sensitive data and have no external connectivity
- Data archives that are read-only and do not permit modification
- Systems scheduled for decommissioning that have been disconnected from production networks
